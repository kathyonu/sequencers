instructions/sequencers_prelaunch_signup.txt

these are the exact commands and changes i made to the clone of the rails-prelaunch-signup app, by Daniel Kehoe.

the COMMANDS in Terminal :

home   $ mkdir clones
home   $ cd ./clones
clones $ git clone https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-prelaunch-signup.git
clones $ cd ./rails-prelaunch-signup
signup $ ls                                                               # to verify it all arrived
signup $ cd ..                                                            # move back to clones directory
clones $ mv ./rails-prelaunch-signup ./sequencers_prelaunch_signup        # to rename the app to our use

The mv command will rename the application  
from  rails-prelaunch-signup 
to    sequencers_prelaunch_signup

The application is now named sequencers_prelaunch_signup.
Now we make the name changes throughout the application wherever the name is used.
Using our TextEdit in iMac we open and edit as needed, these files : 

sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e README                                   # adjust for our app use
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e app/views/layouts/application.html.haml  # adjust Rails Prelaunch Signup
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e app/views/layouts/_navigation.html.haml  # adjust rails-prelaunch-signup
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e config/application.rb                    # adjust RailsPrelaunchSignup to SequencersPrelaunchSignup
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e config/environment.rb                    # adjust RailsPrelaunchSignup to SequencersPrelaunchSignup
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e config/environments/development.rb       # adjust RailsPrelaunchSignup to SequencersPrelaunchSignup
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e config/environments/development.rb       # adjust config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true  Make this false during development. 
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e config/environments/development.rb       # adjust config.action_mailer.smtp_settings if you are using gmail, otherwise comment them out. 
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e config/environments/production.rb        # adjust RailsPrelaunchSignup to SequencersPrelaunchSignup
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e config/environments/production.rb        # adjust config.action_mailer.smtp_settings if you are using gmail, otherwise comment them out. 
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e config/environments/test.rb              # adjust RailsPrelaunchSignup to SequencersPrelaunchSignup
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e config/initializers/devise.rb            # adjust please-change-me-at-config-initializers-devise@example.com to our email address
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e config/initializers/session_store.rb     # adjust _rails_prelaunch_signup_session to _sequencers_prelaunch_signup_session
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e config/initializers/session_store.rb     # adjust RailsPrelaunchSignup to SequencersPrelaunchSignup in two places in the file
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e config/initializers/session_store.rb     # ^^^^^^ that's three changes in the session_store file.
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e config/routes.rb                         # adjust RailsPrelaunchSignup to SequencersPrelaunchSignup
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e config.ru                                # adjust RailsPrelaunchSignup to SequencersPrelaunchSignup
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e Rakefile                                 # adjust RailsPrelaunchSignup to SequencersPrelaunchSignup
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e db/seeds.rb                              # verified First User seed is in the file, no changes made.

I created the sequencers_prelaunch_signup/config/database.yml file, as it is not present in the original repository.
I commented out the config/database.yml ignore command, so the database.yml file will show in the repository.
I included a TODO note to remind myself to uncomment the gitignore line when i add our passwords.

I adjusted the Gemfile to the current gem versions, rails 3.2.2, etc.

Now run the bundle install command.

sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ bundle install
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ bundle update

Now migrate the database : 

sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ bundle exec rake db:migrate
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ bundle exec rake db:seed
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ bundle exec rake db:test:prepare
sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ bundle exec cucumber

all scenarios pass, the app runs in the browser
our work is almost done.

This file will show you all the commands we used to make the changes :
app/instructions/sequencers_prelaunch_signup.txt

Now, we tend to git.

Run the git remote command, you will see you have a remote repository named, origin.

   sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ git remote
     => origin

The origin points to the repository we cloned from in the first steps.
Because we have made changes to this application, and 
because we want to push our changed application to our 
brand new empty git repository, to do so we have to first 
remove our application's knowledge of the git remote named origin.

You will be affecting this file :

	sequencers_prelaunch_signup/.git/config

Run this command to open and view the file, do not change it :

   sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e ./.git/config

Just note the origin information, then close the file, making no change

Run this command : 

   sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ git remote rm origin

Now run git remote again :

   sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ git remote

You will see the response shows no remote repository named origin.
 Note: all we removed is the information identifying the origin, 
  we did not delete the remote origin itself. Prove it to yourself,
   run this command again to see what changed :

   sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ open -e ./.git/config

Visit the repository, it is still there : 

	https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-prelaunch-signup.git


I have created a new git repository for our app : 

	https://github.com/kathyonu/sequencers_prelaunch_signup

Run the git remote add origin command to tell our app where its new home is :

   sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ git remote add origin git@github.com:kathyonu/sequencers_prelaunch_signup.git

Add all the changes to the git index, then commit the changes : 

   sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ git add .
   sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ git commit -m "all changes made from rails-prelaunch-signup to sequencers_prelaunch_signup"

Push the application up to its new home on git : 

   sequencers_prelaunch_signup $ git push -u origin master

I visit the new repository and I see the app :

	https://github.com/kathyonu/sequencers_prelaunch_signup

Ta Da !!  The sequencers_prelaunch_signup app is done.

To see the full results of these commands, see the instructions/sequencers_prelaunch_signup_results.txt
