This application began as a clone of :
https://github.com/railsapps/rails-prelaunch-signup
with our changes for our site use.  To see how we did it,
open the sequencers_prelaunch_signup.txt file in the instructions folder we added.

The original README is as follows : 

Rails Prelaunch Signup
========================

An example Rails 3.2 app for a web startup prelaunch page.

You can use this project as a starting point for a Rails web application. It requires Rails 3.2 or newer and uses Devise http://github.com/plataformatec/devise for user management and authentication.
